\title{Download OSM export}
\usage{
ox_download(bbox, destfile = NULL, use_cached = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{bbox}{bounding box of area to download, determined by a numeric vector
of four values: Western longitude, Southern latitude, Eastern longitude,
Northern latitude (in this order)}

\item{destfile}{path to download the file to. Defaults to a filename
that includes the bbox values so it can be used as cached data (in the
current working directory).}

\item{use_cached}{should the function look for a matching cached file?
Logical, default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
The path is returned so it can easily be piped into the
  \code{\link{ox_read}} function
}
\description{
Download an OSM export by specifying its bounding box, or find a local cached
equivalent. The osmxml package does not further make use of the OSM API,
given that it is mainly intended to be used for editing purposes, as explained
on the API Usage Policy website:
\url{https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/api/}. This function
only mimics the existing \url{https://www.openstreetmap.org} "Export"
functionality to save the user manually downloading the file from the website.
